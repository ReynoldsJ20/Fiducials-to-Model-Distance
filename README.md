# Fiducials-to-Model-Distance
Fiducial to Model Distance module for 3d slicer

This module was developed to address research work at the Canterbury District Health Board, New Zealand. We would like to thank 
Andras Lasso (Queens University) who made valuable contributions to the code and gave useful advice on developing a scripted module.

This module was primarily designed to compute distances from a low density point cloud of fiducial points to the surface of a model. 
Error metrics such as mean distance, root mean square distance, maximum distance and minimum distance are computed and displayed in a table

This module has also been extended to compute distances between two sets of point coulds made from fiducials. This could be used to compute error metrics after a Fiducial to Fiducial registration among other possible uses.
